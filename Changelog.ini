- Extend method javascript() to take a second parameter which is the
number of the CGI form within the HTML page. The allows the module to
operate on an HTML page containing more than one CGI form.
The default value is 0 which is the first form and perhaps the only form
on the page. So no need to upgrade if you only have one form per page
- Update the docs to describe this new parameter
- Note: Original patch kindly supplied by Thomas Goik

Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes (ouside new() ) so no need to upgrade
- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
as per the new standard on such matters. Personally I don't care :-)
- Add more things to MANIFEST.SKIP
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}'
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the SHA1.pm file
which in turn meant this module was omitted from the master index:
